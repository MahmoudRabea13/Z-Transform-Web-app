#  Project Overview
an interactive web app designed to help understanding the concepts of Z-transform and its application.

#### this project was built by python Flask as the main backend language alongside with JavaScript , HTML and CSS as frontend languages

## Key features:

1. Add multiple Zeroes&Poles
2. Import&Export filters
3. Real time Signal Generation
4. Import Signal 
5. Phase Correction using All pass filters

## Project Description:
### 1. Add multiple Zeroes&Poles:
Construct your own filter with multiple Zeroes&Poles showing the magnitude&Phase response of the filter and dynamically apply the constructed filter to either an imported signal or real time generated signal
ability to delete any given pole or zero or even adjust its location

### 2. Import&Export Filters:
Export any filter in CSV format and apply concepts of Z-transform.

also you can Export the any filter you constuct in the app.

### 3. Real time signal generation:
generate real time signal with your mouse where filters are dynamically applied to the generated signal 

#### Low pass filter

#### High pass filter

### 4. import signal:
import any signal in CSV format and dynamically apply the filters to it

### 5. Phase Correction using All pass filters:
apply different all pass filters to either the generated signal or the imported signal and correct the signals' phases 
you are also given a catalog showing many possible all pass filters to help you choose 
you can add&delete multiple all pass filters
